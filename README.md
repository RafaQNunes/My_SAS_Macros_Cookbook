# My SAS Macros Cookbook (by Rafael de Queiroz Nunes)
This is my SAS macros templates, which has useful macros for using in random SAS projects or applications. I call that "my cookbook" because it shows prepared macros and examples of how to apply it.

Files:
- **Cookbook_SAS_Macros.sas**: it's where the macros are saved;
- **Cookbook_Sets.sas**: it sets some configurations for the example application. It's important to check before using it;
- **Cookbook_Application_Examples.sas**: it's where the example are applied using the Cookbook_SAS_Macros.sas macros;
- **Data_Example**: folder where SAS Tables and files are saved for the example applications.
